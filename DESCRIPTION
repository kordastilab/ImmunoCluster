Description: The immunoCluster package provides a complete toolkit to carry out immune profiling of both liquid and imaging high-dimensional mass (CyTOF) and flow cytometry. The package features standardized data infrastructure, using the SingleCellExperiment class object, interactive visualization tools and convenient implementations for popular dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms designed for a non-specialist.
